Your knowledge makes you powerful - use it to save the loyal servants of Arthur!
Be aware that you need to keep your identity secret. If the Assassin learns your true identity, evil will ultimately prevail.
(6 players or more): Your loyal knight Percival knows of your identity and will try to protect you at all costs.
(10 players): The evil witch Morgana has confused Percival by posing as Merlin herself. Blasphemy!
